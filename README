Internal encoding:
* Should be as unicoded as possible
* BSDCONV special chars are prefixed with 00
* UNICODE is prefixed with 01
* CNS11643 is prefixed with 02

NOTICE:
Though many charset encoding is ascii-compatible,
 ascii is excluded from their codecs to provide flexibility.

Very useful for migrating MySQL DB from Big5 to UTF-8
> bsdconv htmlentity,big5-5c,big5,ascii::utf-8,ascii in.sql out.sql

More example:
> bsdconv big5,ascii:nl2br:ascii,html-img in.txt out.htm
#html-img is actually ASCII-HTML-UNICODE-IMG

> bsdconv ascii,utf-8:ascii,ascii-html-cns11643-img in.txt out.htm
#if you prefer to use glyph image from http://www.cns11643.gov.tw
